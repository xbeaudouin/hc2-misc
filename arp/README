This code is an ARP Ping function that allow users to check is a mobile device
that does, for example Wifi, is present or not in the House (ou near the house).

Idea if to check on the ARP table on Unix server (Tested on Linux with a Raspberry PI, and FreeBSD)
that the named host is in the local ARP table.

This is far more usuable than ping, since some devices like iPhones are not every time on the
Wifi to avoid too mutch usage of battery.

You have to check that ARP table on the host is not cleaned too early.
On FreeBSD add : net.link.ether.inet.max_age=1800 on your /etc/sysctl.conf file.

On Linux : TODO

Seem that on Raspberry PI with Avahi the TTL of ARP cache table is very high. Didn't yet 
find a reason.

Files :
arp.pl : the CGI perl script to be executed as CGI. 
arpping.lua: the button code used to check if the user is here or not.
presence.vfib : the HC Virtual device
